# Data Science Blog Project 

Motivation for the project
This is an interesting data set that allows us to shed light on an otherwise opaque industry. This analysis would be helpful to investors better understand the opportunities available to them and start-ups to know who are the key investors in their industry.

Files in the repository
1. Jupyter notebook analysis in Python using the Anaconda distribution of libraries. 
2. CSV file containing data related investments in Indian start-ups

Summary of the results 
- This analysis shows that there are a few active investors in Indian start-ups, though a significant number of smaller investors.
- Investment tends to be concentrated in a few industries, specifically consumer internet and technology.
- Some investors tend to specialise in specific industries while other diversify across industries.
