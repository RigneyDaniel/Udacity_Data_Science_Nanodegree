# Using Pyspark to Predict User Churn**
This project is the capstone assignment for the Udactiy Data Science Nanodegree.

----

## Project Overview
In this assignment we are working with data from a digital music streaming service. The aim of the project is to be able to predict the 'churn' or the probability a user of the service will leave so that we can decide whether to offer the user incentives to stay.

We train three classifiers (Decision Trees, Random Forest and Gradient Boosting) on the data using cross-validation and hyperparamete tuning.

The results are show in the code or can be seen on this blog : https://medium.com/@daniel.rigney98/using-pyspark-to-predict-user-churn-aaedacbb767
